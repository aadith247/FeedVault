# FeedVault

FeedVault is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with TypeScript. It helps users store and manage important social media feeds like YouTube and Twitter. You can save URLs, convert them into embeddable content, organize them with tags, and add personal notes. Plus, it’s easy to search for your saved feeds using tags or keywords. In the future, FeedVault will also feature an AI-powered summarizer to make it easier to digest content.

## Features
